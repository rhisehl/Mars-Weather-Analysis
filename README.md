# Mars Article Scraping

The Mars Planet Science webpage was scraped to gather a list of articles and their preview text.

# Mars Weather Analysis

The Mission to Mars table on Mars Temperature data was scrpated to gather the weather information.

Next, the data was input into a DataFrame for easier analysis.

## Overall Analysis Summary

There are 12 months on Mars, just as there are 12 months on Earth. Throughout the entire dataset, a total of 1977 Martian days' worth of data was collected. 

Temperatures on Mars are the lowest in the third month and highest in the eighth month (with average minimum temperatures of -83.3 and -68.4, respectively). These temperatures are, as a whole, significantly lower than what is standard on Earth.

 Daily temperature minimums can be seen below for the length of the project. This information can also be used to estimate the length of a Martian year by calculating the peak-to-peak distance (approximately 675 Earth days).

Atomsphereic pressure tends to be lowest in the sixth month, while it is highest in the nineth month (just one month after the highest temperatures of the year).
